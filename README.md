This Java program implements a simple Car Rental System using 
an abstract Vehicle class (with a Car subclass) to represent
vehicles, each having attributes like ID, brand, model, 
price per day, and availability. A CarRentalSystem class manages
the fleet and reservations, allowing users to display 
all vehicles, check available ones, and make reservations.
The Payment class processes payments, while the Reservation
class tracks bookings, linking customers to vehicles and 
calculating rental costs. A graphical user interface (GUI) 
built with AWT enables user interaction, providing options to view the fleet
, check availability, make reservations, and view bookings. Buttons,text fields,
and a text area are used for input and displaying information, making the system user-friendly and efficient.
